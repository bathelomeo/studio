            All studios have terrabytes.
            The byte is a unit of that can hold any digital information.
            A normal gigabyte most commonly consists of eight bits.
            In my word a normal byte is a place where you can download things.
            A terra byte is one of the biggest byte ever.
            before terrabytes there is kilobytes.
